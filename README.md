In this challenge, I needed to find three flags (FLAG1, FLAG2, FLAG3) by analyzing a set of books and their reviews. 
The steps involved hashing, filtering data, and using simple machine learning for suspicious review detection.

Step 1: Find FLAG1 – Book
-> First, I computed a hash from my numeric ID (STU150) using SHA256 and took the first 8 characters.
-> Then, I filtered the books.csv dataset to find books with:
           rating_number = 1234
           average_rating = 5.0
-> For each filtered book, I checked its reviews (from reviews.csv) to see if any review contains my hash.
-> When I found the matching book, I extracted the book title, removed spaces, and took the first 8 characters.
-> Finally, I computed SHA256 of this 8-character string. The resulting hash is FLAG1.

Step 2: Find FLAG2 – Fake Review
-> Once I had the matched book, I again looked at all its reviews.
-> FLAG2 was simply my original hash (hash8) that appeared in one of the reviews.

Step 3: Find FLAG3 – Top Words from Genuine Reviews
-> I focused only on 5-star reviews for the matched book.
-> I created a simple labeling rule for suspicious reviews:
-> Short reviews (<60 characters) containing superlative words like best, amazing, excellent were labeled suspicious (1).
-> All other reviews were considered genuine (0).
-> I used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert review text into numbers that the model can understand. I also removed empty values.
-> I trained a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a review is suspicious or genuine.
-> I calculated a suspicion score for each review and selected the bottom 40% scores as genuine reviews.
-> Then, I used SHAP to understand which words in the genuine reviews reduce suspicion the most.
-> I selected the top 3 words that reduce suspicion.
-> I combined these top 3 words with my numeric ID and hashed them to create FLAG3.
